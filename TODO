TODO for the JSONReader PHP extension
-------------------------------------

- FIXME: malloc() is used to allocate the stream read buffer

- Allow reading of overflowing integer or float values as strings 

- Implement flexible error handling (throw exceptions, internal error handler)

- Add the ability to pass specific configuration options to the constructor 
  (max nesting level, read buffer size, error handling method...)

- Consider: define specific type constants in addition to the VALUE constant


Additions that will require improvements to libvktor:
-----------------------------------------------------

- Add some abilities to skip ahead 
  - Over the current value token without reading it
  - To a specific key in an object
  - A specific number of elements in an array or an object
  - Out of the current nesting level ("step out")

- Add support for additional Unicode encodings (input or output)

- Internal: allow changing the memory allocation functions for better
  embedding in PHP
